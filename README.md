Disscution about this mod, takes place in the [official forum](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/c208b-grand-caravan-ex-mods-general/322172?u=magrainaone)

**Based on Sim version 1.21.18.0 (SU7)**

***Engine and Flight Model***
- Corrected Different Values according to POH
- Reverse thrust is stregthened and has noticible effect on the plane
- 4 minutes of engine overstress (operating above max torque limit) cause CAS message about metal chips in the oil and increase probability of the engine failure.
The average time of engine failure after metal chips appearance is 100 minutes. The event is random so you may not experience engine failure if you are gentle with throttle.
If the engine is kept overstressed the probability of the engine failure increases. Each second of keeping the engine above the torque limit decreases the expected enigne failure time by 8 second.  
You can disable/enable engine failures in the MSFS Assistance Options.

***Ground Handling***

- Tighter turning circle
